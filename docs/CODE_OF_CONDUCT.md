# Code of Conduct [DRAFT]

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, Soundplay contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of disability, race, nationality, ethnicity, age, personal appearance, body size, religion, (technical) level of experience, gender expression or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

In order to form a welcoming and inviting community there is a need for some foundational ethical code of standards. Micro policing members would be too difficult a task: it would be much simpler to list a few dos and don'ts that members can adhere to. Hence, the following examples below are provided to clarify what we classify as good and bad behaviour.

## Acceptable behavior

- Using welcoming language.
- Being respectful of differing (technical) viewpoints.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the code base  and project.
- Showing empathy towards other community members during peer reviewing code.
- Memes are very much encouraged.
- (Good) Jokes are welcomed as well.

## Unacceptable behaviour

> **Note**: Any and all false alarms about members exhibiting the offenses mentioned below would be treated with the same effect as breaking the Code Of Conduct.

- The use of explicit sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, unless explicitly implied/intended as a *joke*.
- Explicit insulting/derogatory comments and personal attacks.
- Explicit public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information such as medical records or physical/electronic address without explicit permission.
- Keep politics out: its just a sound player.
- Use of "*politically right*" narratives as a means for infringing on individual freedom of thought/expression.
- Just don't be a butt.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior, and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code Of Conduct, or to ban - either temporarily or permanently - any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, offensive, and or harmful.

## Scope

This Code Of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces, when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the [project maintainer](zero1729@protonmail.com) (Zero-1729) via email. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident; we won't dox you.

Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce this Code Of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions (when necessary, as determined by other members of the project's leadership).

## Attribution

This Code Of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4
